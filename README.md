# Recap Project IV - Weather & Activities App

In this recap project I created an app that fetches a weather object from an API and conditionally picks activities from a list to display as suggestions. I implemented a feature that allows the user to add more suggestions to the list of activities and also allows the user to delete suggestions.

The way this app is going to handle data is a basic example of CRUD operations.
